For a high-level overview of data management in sfaira, read :ref:`data_life_cycle_rst` first.

Build data repository locally
------------------------------

Build a repository structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1. Choose a directory to dedicate to the data base, called root in the following.
    2. Run the sfaira download script (sfaira.data.utils.download_all). Alternatively, you can manually set up a data base by making subfolders for each study.

Note that the automated download is a feature of sfaira but not the core purpose of the package:
Sfaira allows you efficiently interact with such a local data repository.
Some data sets cannot be automatically downloaded and need you manual intervention, which we report in the download script output.

Use 3rd party repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some organization provide streamlined data objects that can be directly consumed by data zoos such as sfaira.
One example for such an organization is the cellxgene_ data portal.
Through these repositories, one can easily build or extend a collection of data sets that can be easily interfaced with sfaira.
Data loaders for cellxgene structured data objects will be available soon!
Contact us for support of any other repositories.
