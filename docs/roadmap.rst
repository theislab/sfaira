~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We are currently migrating our ontology to use the Cell Ontology_ as a backbone.

Interface online data repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We are preparing to interface online data repositories which provide streamlined data.
This allows users to build local data set collections more easily because these providers usually have a clear download interface,
consider the cellxgene_ data portal for example.
We aim to represent both these data set portals and data sets that have not been streamlined in such a fashion to provide a comprehensive collection of as many data sets as possible.
